I was able to implement local alignment to some extent in the align.py but was unable to debug all the bugs. 

I also want to use my 1 Free Gift for this assignment. 


DNA

python3 align.py -i dnaseq1.txt -j dnaseq2.txt -o out1.txt -p F -atype G

Resulting File: out1.txt

python3 align.py -i dnaseq1.txt -j dnaseq2.txt -o out2.txt -p F -atype S

Resulting File: out2.txt




PROTEIN

python3 align.py -i proteinseq1.txt -j proteinseq2.txt -o protein1.txt -p T -atype G

Resulting File: protein1.txt


python3 align.py -i proteinseq1.txt -j proteinseq2.txt -o protein1.txt -p T -atype S

Resulting File: protein2.txt

python3 align.py -i proteinseq1.txt -j proteinseq3.txt -o protein1.txt -p T -atype G

Resulting File: protein3.txt


python3 align.py -i proteinseq1.txt -j proteinseq3.txt -o protein1.txt -p T -atype S

Resulting File: protein4.txt
