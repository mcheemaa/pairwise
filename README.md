# Dynamic Programming and Pairwise Sequence Alignment

The program performs pairwise sequence alignment of two protein sequences or two DNA sequences depending on the user's configuration of parameters. It can also perform global sequence alignment,  semi-global sequence alignment, and local sequence alignment depending on the user's configuration. The program chooses the corresponding scoring matrix - dnaMatrix or BLOSUM45 - file depending on if it is a protein sequence alignment or DNA sequence alignment.
